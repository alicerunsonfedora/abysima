1. Generate a network that will verify whether a word is "valid" or not, based on the structures of existing English and Japanese words.
2. Write a random word generator that will generate a new word.
3. Feed words into the neural network to validate certain words to create a small dictionary.
4. Analyze the resulting validated words.
5. Attempt researching why GANs fail at creating a language, using analysis from word generator.
