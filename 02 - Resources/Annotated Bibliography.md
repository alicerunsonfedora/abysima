## [S] DeepGRP: Engineering a Software...

Hausmann, Fabian, and Stefan Kurtz. “DeepGRP: Engineering a Software Tool for Predicting Genomic Repetitive Elements Using Recurrent Neural Networks with Attention.” _Algorithms for Molecular Biology_, vol. 16, no. 1, Aug. 2021, pp. 1–13. _EBSCOhost_, doi:10.1186/s13015-021-00199-0.

This article discusses the use of recurrent neural networks to create software that will predict reptitive elements in genomes. Although this topic in and of itself does not pertain to this particular paper, the topic of using a recurrent neural network is crucial. Essentially, this will help me understand how these types of networks are used in real-world scenarios, and how the authors went about using them.

## [G] An Introduction to Generative...

Matcha, Anil Chandra Naidu. “An Introduction to Generative Deep Learning.” _Analytics Vidhya_, 16 Oct. 2019, https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/an-introduction-to-generative-deep-learning-792e93d1c6d4.

Although not a scholarly source, this article on Medium provides enough background information on how generative deep learning works, which should provide context for how to design a generative deep learning system capable of creating a language.

## [G] What Are Recurrent Neural Networks?

“What Are Recurrent Neural Networks?” _IBM Cloud Learning Hub_, IBM Cloud Education, 14 Sept. 2020, https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/recurrent-neural-networks.

Although IBM is not a scholarly source, their article on recurrent neural networks should also provide context for how they work and whether or not this is a good network to use when generating a neural network for language creation.
