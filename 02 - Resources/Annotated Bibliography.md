This article discusses the use of recurrent neural networks to create software that will predict reptitive elements in genomes. Although this topic in and of itself does not pertain to this particular paper, the topic of using a recurrent neural network is crucial. Essentially, this will help me understand how these types of networks are used in real-world scenarios, and how the authors went about using them.
