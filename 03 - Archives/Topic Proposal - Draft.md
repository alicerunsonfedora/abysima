# Topic Proposal

I've noticed a lot of work being done in the computational linguistics sector with respect to natural language processing and classification in languages with machine learning; simultaneously, I've also been noticing that we're exploring how we can use artificial intelligence and machine learning to _create_ works of art, music, and other things. I propose that, for this paper, I will experiment with creating a neural network that will _attempt_ to create a new language (not a programming language) based on linguistics data in various sectors (phonology, morphology, etc.) and use this as a platform to discuss the implications of such a technology for the future. Such implications may include better natural language processing, better classification of lexical categories, or even more creative endeavours such as creating custom languages for games.

Thus far, I have taken a look into how the tools I'd likely use works thanks to my advanced machine learning class, and I have designed a very basic [[Experimentation Checklist]] which outlines what I plan to do in regards to primary research and experimentation.

I still need to look for some additional secondary sources to cite in the paper, and I have yet to create the neural network to try and create a language with. My topic seems relatively novel, however, as my search results for generating languages with AI and machine learning are very limited in the EBSCO databases. The first draft of the paper has also yet to be written, but this can't be completed until I've tried to create the neural network.

Some questions I have for you would be:
- Do you have any recommended topics that have some alignment with my propsal that I can use to find some sources?
- Given the inter-disciplinary nature of the project, should I consider consolidating the workload by communicating with my machine learning professor to make it a "shared project" (not in the collaborative sense)?
