# Topic Proposal

I've noticed a lot of work being done in the computational linguistics sector with respect to natural language processing and classification in languages with machine learning; simultaneously, I've also been noticing that we're exploring how we can use artificial intelligence and machine learning to _create_ works of art, music, and other things. I propose that, for this paper, I will experiment with creating a neural network that will _attempt_ to create a new language (not a programming language) based on linguistics data in various sectors (phonology, morphology, etc.) and use this as a platform to discuss the implications of such a technology for the future. Such implications may include better natural language processing, better classification of lexical categories, or even more creative endeavours such as creating custom languages for games.

Thus far, I have taken a look into how the tools I'd likely use works thanks to my advanced machine learning class, and I have designed a very basic [[Experimentation Checklist]] which outlines what I plan to do in regards to primary research and experimentation.

At this time, I will need to focus on adding more secondary sources to the annotated bibliography and creating the generative networks to test out the ideas I have proposed. The proposal also needs to be updated to match the requirements Prof. Narock requests for the project proposal in the machine learning aspects of this project.
