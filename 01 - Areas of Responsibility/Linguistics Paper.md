# Project Abysima: Determining Word Validity to Generate Random Words for a New Language

Language is one of the most complex and powerful tools humankind has designed and used for centuries. Being able to communicate ideas in such a way that other have agreed upon using sounds and symbols is incredible. This powerful tool has let us discuss research and ideas for experimentation, leading us to new technologies like machine learning. Over the years, we've designed and engineered many machine learning algorithms that can redraw images in a particular style, create or extend music, and even write stories that can be used for video games. Given that we can create these generative networks, this begs the question of whether we can utilize machine learning to create languages. The task would be very daunting and take longer than a semester to study, so I instead proposed an experiment where I generated words against a machine learning model to validate them as possible words in a given language.

## Background
Machine learning models are specialized algorithms that attempt to emulate how the human brain works when learning new data. Fundamentally, these algorithms utilize various mathematical operations with matrices and vectors to accomplish this. When a model is given an input to predict, it will attempt to perform those mathematical operations to determine a specific type of output. While engineers and data scientists know that the model will perform these operations, the order in which they are applied, as well as what numbers the model will use, are hidden from the engineers.

## Methods
To begin designing the experiment, I first settled on the type of machine learning model I will need to accomplish
