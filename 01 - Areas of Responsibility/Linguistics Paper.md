# Project Abysima: Determining Word Validity to Generate Random Words

Language is one of the most complex and powerful tools humankind has designed and used for centuries. Being able to communicate ideas in such a way that other have agreed upon using sounds and symbols is incredible. This powerful tool has let us discuss research and ideas for experimentation, leading us to new technologies like machine learning. Over the years, we've designed and engineered many machine learning algorithms that can redraw images in a particular style, create or extend music, and even write stories that can be used for video games. Given that we can create these generative networks, this begs the question, which I aim to answer: _can we use machine learning to generate a language the same way we do for art and music?_
