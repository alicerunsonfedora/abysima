The main objective of the project is the following:\n\n- Can we get a machine learning algorithm to generate a language?\n- What linguistic properties can we use to improve these algorithms?\n- Can we make linguistics and linguistic properties easy to understand for a neural network?\n\nThe following CoreML models add in networks that provide some basic functionalities toward this goal, namely:\n\n- Word validation.","version":"1.1","authorName":"Marquis Kurt","createdDate":"2021-11-09T13:50:41Z","license":"MPLv2.0","activityEntities":["projectCreated",[{"id":"EA702020-6AD2-444D-BA28-7E8BF75B08B2","title":"Project Created","createdDate":"2021-11-09T13:50:41Z","event":"projectCreated","subtitle":"AbysimaML"}]],"taskType":"generalClassifier","title":"Tabular Classification","location":"","versionErrorTitle":"Project file cannot be opened.","modifiedDate":"2021-11-09T14:50:04Z","settingsEntity":{"snapshotOnExtendTraining":true,"snapshotOnResumeTraining":false},"versionErrorSubtitle":"You need a newer version of Create ML to open this file.
