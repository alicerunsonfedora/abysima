## What is Project Abysima?

**Project Abysima** is an attempt a creating a generative neural network that will devise its own language (not programming) based off of existing linguistic rules across languages. The main objective of the project is the following:

- Can we get a machine learning algorithm to generate a language?
- What linguistic properties can we use to improve these algorithms?
- Can we make linguistics and linguistic properties easy to understand for a neural network?

## General Organization

The organization of this project is broken down into four domains:

- **Projects** contains series of tasks that are linked to a specific goal with a given deadline.
- **Areas of Responsibility** contain a sphere of activity that will be maintained over time.
- **Resources** contains themes, topics, and other notes of interest.
- **Archives** contain archived data from the previously mentioned areas.
