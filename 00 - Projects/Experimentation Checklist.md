# Experimentation Checklist

- [x] Consult with Tom Narock and Susan about inter-disciplinary project
- [ ] Devise an experiment for how to create a language with
	- [ ] Research Generative Deep Learning, Recurrent Neural Networks (see [[Potential Avenues]])
- [ ] Create data models to feed into neural networks
- [ ] Create neural networks with Keras/Jupyter Notebooks
- [ ] Train and test the network
- [ ] Analyze what the network prioritizes in language generation
